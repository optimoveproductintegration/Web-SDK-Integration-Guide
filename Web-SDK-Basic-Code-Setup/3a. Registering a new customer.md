# Registering a new customer

## Step 1
In the same Google Tag Manager account: 
* Create a new trigger and make it "register_user_trigger" 
* Set the Trigger Type to "Form Submission"
* Check "Wait for Tags" and set the "Max wait time" to 6000 milliseconds
* In the "Enable this trigger when all of these conditions are true" field select "Page URL" equals "(the URL where the form for a customer to create and account is located)"
* Set the trigger to fire on "Some Forms"
* Set the "Fire this trigger when an Event occurs and all of these conditions are true" to "Page URL" equals "(the same URL you entered above)"

## Step 2
In the tag section of Google Tag Manager: 
* Create a new tag and name it "register_user_tag" 
* Set the type to "Custom HTML" 
* Set the firing trigger to "register_user_trigger"

## Step 3
In the "Custom HTML" field for the "register_user_tag"

Input this code:

```javascript
<script type="text/javascript">

// Register user variables
var SDK_ID = document.getElementById("Email").value;
var email = document.getElementById("Email").value;

// passing the variables to the SDK function
optimoveSDK.API.registerUser(SDK_ID, email)


</script>
```

>**Note:**
In the example code above, we're using the email address as our SDK_ID, so we retrieve the email address that the customer enters when submitting the create account form. If you're using a different SDK_ID, this variable will have to retrive that information.

>**Note:**
Also, you should edit this code in order to find the best way to access the information that you need for your sdk id. For example, if you're not using email for your sdk id, but something else, you will need to edit this code to access that id.

## Step 4
* Save the register_user_tag that you've just created
* Click the "Preview" button at the top right of GTM in order to check the changes on your site
